# tkinter-edit
A basic text editor made in Tkinter with a character count.

## Usage
- Opens a home file on start (`tkinter_edit_save.txt`).
- Save, create and open files using the menu bar.
- Files are not created until they are saved.
- The character count terminates at the symbol `---`.

This application is unsafe; you may run Python statements using the menu bar.
